							  ## **Node.js Learning Guide: From Beginner to Advanced**

									### **Beginner Topics**

								  #### **1. Introduction to Node.js**


- **What is Node.js?**
  - A runtime environment that allows you to run JavaScript on the server side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine and supports non-blocking, event-driven I/O operations.
  
- **Why Node.js?**
  - It's ideal for creating fast, scalable network applications, especially suitable for I/O-heavy tasks like real-time communication.

- **Example: Basic Node.js Server**

  const http = require('http');

  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    res.statusCode = 200;
    res.setHeader('Content-Type', 'text/plain');
    res.end('Hello World\n');
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log(`Server running at http://localhost:${3000}/`);
  });
 


									#### **2. Core Modules**


- **Understanding Core Modules**
  - Node.js comes with built-in modules such as `http`, `fs`, `path`, and `url` that do not require separate installation.
  
- **Example: Using the `fs` Module to Read a File**
 
  const fs = require('fs');

  fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
      console.error(err);
      return;
    }
    console.log(data);
  });
  

								#### **3. Creating a Basic HTTP Server**



- **HTTP Server Basics**
  - Learn how to handle web requests and send responses.

- **Example: Handling Different Routes**
  
  const http = require('http');

  const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
    switch (req.url) {
      case '/':
        res.end('Welcome to the homepage!');
        break;
      case '/about':
        res.end('Welcome to the about page!');
        break;
      default:
        res.statusCode = 404;
        res.end('404: Page Not Found');
        break;
    }
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
  });
  ```

									### **Intermediate Topics**

								   #### **4. Asynchronous Programming**



- **Concepts: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await**
  - Essential for handling operations without blocking the main thread.

- **Example: Using Async/Await**
 
  const fs = require('fs').promises;

  async function readFile(filePath) {
    try {
      const data = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf8');
      console.log(data);
    } catch (error) {
      console.error('An error occurred:', error);
    }
  }

  readFile('example.txt');
 

								#### **5. Working with External Modules**


- **Using npm (Node Package Manager)**
  - Manage third-party libraries and dependencies.

- **Example: Setting up an Express Server**
  
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();

  app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello World!');
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('App running on port 3000');
  });
  ```

									### **Advanced Topics**

								   #### **6. Building RESTful APIs**


- **Creating API Endpoints with Express**
  - Develop and manage complex API interactions.

- **Example: Express REST API**
  
  const express = require('express');
  const app = express();
  app.use(express.json());

  app.get('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    res.send([{ name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' }]);
  });

  app.post('/api/users', (req, res) => {
    res.status(201).send(req.body);
  });

  app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on port 3000.');
  });
  ```

								#### **7. Streaming and Buffering**


- **What are Streams?**
  - Handle large data efficiently by working with data in chunks.

- **Example: Using Streams**
  
  const fs = require('fs');
  const readableStream = fs.createReadStream('largefile.txt');
  const writableStream = fs.createWriteStream('newfile.txt');

  readableStream.on('data', function(chunk) {
    writableStream.write(chunk);
  });

  readableStream.on('end', function() {
    writableStream.end();
  });
 

							#### **8. Advanced Networking with Socket.io**


- **Real-time Communication**
  - Enable interactive, bidirectional communication between clients and servers.

- **Example: Using Socket.io**
 
  const express = require('express');
  const http = require('http');
  const socketIo = require('socket.io');

  const app = express();
  the server = http.createServer(app);
  const io = socketIo(server);

  io.on('connection', (socket) => {
    console.log('A user connected');
    socket.on('disconnect', () => {
      console.log('User disconnected');
    });
  });

  server.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Listening on port 3000');
  });
